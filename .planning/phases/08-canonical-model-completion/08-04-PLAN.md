<objective>
Update Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md to claim ING-01, ING-02, CORE-01, CORE-02 as satisfied with evidence citations referencing the work completed in plans 08-01, 08-02, and 08-03.

Purpose: Phase 1 verification found these four requirements orphaned or partially met. Plans 08-01 through 08-03 closed the model/schema gaps. This plan updates the verification document to reflect that all four requirements are now satisfied, with concrete evidence citations. Per CONTEXT.md: "Import infrastructure is documented and claimed in Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md." No new code in this plan.
Output: Updated Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md with all 4 success criteria verified and requirement traceability resolved.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md with satisfied requirement status</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/01-mission-orchestration-and-apply-evidence/01-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>Update the Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md document. This is a re-verification after gap closure by Phase 8.

Update the frontmatter:
- `status: passed` (was `gaps_found`)
- `score: 4/4 success criteria verified` (was `2/4`)
- `re_verification: true` (was `false`)

Update each gap entry to reflect resolution:

**SC2 (ING-02):** Change status to `satisfied`. Add evidence:
- `src/STIGForge.Core/Models/ContentPack.cs` — BenchmarkIds, ApplicabilityTags, Version, Release fields added
- `src/STIGForge.Infrastructure/Storage/DbBootstrap.cs` — SQLite schema migrated with benchmark_ids_json, applicability_tags_json, version, release columns
- `src/STIGForge.Infrastructure/Storage/SqliteRepositories.cs` — Repository CRUD persists new fields with JSON serialization
- `tests/STIGForge.UnitTests/Core/ContentPackModelTests.cs` — Unit tests for field defaults and assignment
- Resolved by: Phase 8, Plan 08-01

**SC3 (CORE-01):** Change status to `satisfied`. Add evidence:
- `src/STIGForge.Core/Models/ControlRecord.cs` — SourcePackId provenance field added
- `src/STIGForge.Content/Import/ContentPackImporter.cs` — Import sets SourcePackId on each control
- `tests/STIGForge.UnitTests/Core/ControlRecordModelTests.cs` — Unit tests for SourcePackId defaults
- `tests/STIGForge.UnitTests/Content/ContentPackImporterTests.cs` — Tests verify provenance wiring
- Resolved by: Phase 8, Plan 08-02

**SC4 (CORE-02):** Change status to `satisfied`. Add evidence:
- `src/STIGForge.Core/Models/VerificationResult.cs` — Canonical verification result contract
- `src/STIGForge.Core/Models/EvidenceRecord.cs` — Canonical evidence record contract
- `src/STIGForge.Core/Models/ExportIndexEntry.cs` — Canonical export index entry contract
- `src/STIGForge.Core/Models/CanonicalContract.cs` — Version 1.1.0, 8 type name constants
- `tests/STIGForge.UnitTests/Core/CanonicalSchemaTests.cs` — Tests for all types and version
- Resolved by: Phase 8, Plan 08-03

Update the Requirements Coverage table to show ING-01, ING-02, CORE-01, CORE-02 as satisfied with Phase 8 as the resolver.

Update the Gaps Summary to note that all gaps have been closed by Phase 8 (Canonical Model Completion).

Add a "Re-verification" section at the bottom documenting that this re-verification was performed after Phase 8 gap closure work, referencing the three plans.

Update the ING-01 entry: it was already verified (SC1 passed) but listed as "ORPHANED" because no plan claimed it. Note that ING-01 is satisfied by existing import infrastructure (ImportInboxScanner, ImportDedupService, ImportQueuePlanner, ContentPackImporter) with test evidence: ContentPackImporterTests.cs, RoundTripTests.cs, GpoParserTests.cs. The "orphaned" status was a traceability issue (phantom requirement IDs), not a code gap.</action>
  <verify>Read the updated 01-VERIFICATION.md and confirm: status is `passed`, score is `4/4`, all four requirements show `satisfied`, evidence citations reference concrete file paths.</verify>
  <done>Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md updated with all 4 success criteria verified, all 4 requirements (ING-01, ING-02, CORE-01, CORE-02) marked satisfied with evidence citations.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md status is `passed` with `4/4` score
- All four requirements (ING-01, ING-02, CORE-01, CORE-02) have `satisfied` status
- Each requirement cites concrete source files and test files as evidence
- Re-verification section documents Phase 8 gap closure
- No new code files created (documentation-only plan)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Import infrastructure is documented and claimed in Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md. All four orphaned requirements are marked satisfied with traceable evidence citations. Phase 1 can be marked as fully passed.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/08-canonical-model-completion/08-04-SUMMARY.md`
