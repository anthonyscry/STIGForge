<objective>
Stitch Phase 09 verification evidence into the Phase 12 promotion workflow so that WP-01/02/03 requirements are traceable through promotion contracts and automated reconciliation.

Purpose: Make evidence promotion deterministic by documenting intake points, wiring checks, and fail-closed reconciliation before executing the remaining Phase 12 milestones.

Output: Concrete tasks that capture evidence paths, promotion contract checks, and reconciliation scripts ready for implementation planning in later plans.

    Catalog the evidence items from Phase 09 that satisfy WP-01/02/03 by:
    1. Listing the verification artifacts referenced in the Phase 09 verification doc and summary that are still authoritative for parity checks.
    2. Mapping those artifacts to WP-01/02/03 requirement statements (identifying gaps if any) and recording the links in the Phase 12 evidence tracker.
    3. Noting any metadata (paths, IDs, timestamps) needed to verify the integrity of those sources before promotion.

    Define the points in the promotion pipeline where evidence contracts are verified by:
    1. Identifying expected inputs/outputs for each promotion stage documented in the Phase 12 verification milestone.
    2. Specifying wiring assertions (paths, signatures, requirement tags) that must hold before promotion can proceed.
    3. Capturing these checks in a contract checklist that the automation can enforce for WP-01/02/03.

    Outline a deterministic reconciliation process by:
    1. Selecting three source types (e.g., Phase 09 summary, promotion contract, and live verification log) that must agree before promotion.
    2. Defining the fail-closed behavior when mismatches occur, including alerting, halting promotion, and recording the discrepancy.
    3. Ensuring every reconciliation path is linked back to WP-01/02/03 so the automation can produce traceable REQUIREMENTS evidence.

1. Evidence catalog references Phase 09 milestone verification and summary files for WP-01/02/03.
2. Promotion contract wires list the expected inputs and signatures from Phase 12 verification evidence.
3. Reconciliation outline shows fail-closed handling for each of the three sources with REQUIREMENTS traceability.

<success_criteria>
- Phase 09 evidence mapped to WP-01/02/03 and documented with metadata.
- Promotion wiring checks cover all hand-offs before promotion can continue.
- Reconciliation strategy enforces fail-closed behavior across three sources with requirements trace provenance.
</success_criteria>

<output>
Produce these concrete artifacts:
1. Task 1 artifact (`Intake Phase 09 evidence`): `.planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/12-wpf-parity-evidence-promotion-and-verification/12-VERIFICATION.md` updated with:
   - Source evidence intake mapping for `WP-01`..`WP-03` to Phase 09 verification + summary anchors.
2. Task 2 artifact (`Promotion wiring checks`): `.planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/12-wpf-parity-evidence-promotion-and-verification/12-VERIFICATION.md` updated with promotion wiring checklist entries for workflow/severity/recovery contracts and gate expectations.
3. Task 3 artifacts (`Fail-closed reconciliation`): `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` updated only if WP closure evidence is fully aligned; otherwise retain pending state with explicit unresolved note in Phase 12 verification.
4. Plan execution summary artifact: `.planning/phases/12-wpf-parity-evidence-promotion-and-verification/12-01-SUMMARY.md` documenting commands run, evidence links, and final closure posture.
