<objective>
Backfill the missing Phase 08 verification artifacts so UR-01 through UR-04 have machine-readable closure evidence, synchronized metadata, and fail-closed traceability referenced from the upgrade/rebase operator workflow milestone.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create or verify Phase 08 verification artifact with UR evidence and fail-closed verdicts</name>
  <files>.planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow/08-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>Ensure `.planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow/08-VERIFICATION.md` exists (or is created) with a deterministic structure that includes sections for scope, verification commands, requirement evidence mapping, command results, and a three-source cross-check table covering UR-01 through UR-04. Map each UR to concrete evidence (Phase 08 summaries, code/docs references) and derive fail-closed verdicts: only mark a UR closed if every mapped evidence source is confirmed.</action>
  <verify>Run `rg --line-number "^# Phase 08 Verification - Upgrade/Rebase Operator Workflow|^## Requirement Evidence Mapping|^## Three-Source Cross-Check|UR-0[1-4]" .planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow/08-VERIFICATION.md` and confirm required sections plus all UR IDs are present and verdict columns reference explicit evidence.</verify>
  <done>`08-VERIFICATION.md` has the prescribed sections, lists UR-01..UR-04 with mapped artifacts, and shows unresolved status for any missing source so closure stays fail-closed.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Align Phase 08 summary metadata with UR completion list</name>
  <files>.planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow-01-SUMMARY.md, .planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow-02-SUMMARY.md</files>
  <action>Add or verify identical `requirements-completed` frontmatter in both Phase 08 summary files, listing UR-01 through UR-04 in the same order. Leave the narrative content untouched; only touch metadata so tooling can cross-reference the verification artifact.</action>
  <verify>Run `rg --line-number "requirements-completed|UR-0[1-4]" .planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow-0[12]-SUMMARY.md` and ensure each file exposes the same metadata block with precisely the four UR entries.</verify>
  <done>Both summaries declare identical `requirements-completed: [UR-01, UR-02, UR-03, UR-04]` arrays in frontmatter, matching the verification artifact IDs.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Reconcile `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` statuses with verification artifacts</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md, .planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow/08-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>Update `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` so each UR row still in Phase 11 traceability remains pending until the verification artifact and summary metadata confirm closure. After Task 1 and Task 2 evidence exist, switch UR-01..UR-04 to Completed with Phase 11 as primary source. Preserve fail-closed semantics: if any artifact lacks evidence, keep that UR unresolved. Mirror the final statuses in the Phase 08 three-source cross-check table and note any mismatches.</action>
  <verify>Run `rg --line-number "\| UR-0[1-4] \| Phase 11 \| (Pending|Completed) \|" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md && rg --line-number "UR-0[1-4].*(closed|ready-for-closure|unresolved)" .planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow/08-VERIFICATION.md` to confirm consistency and fail-closed alignment between files.</verify>
  <done>`REQUIREMENTS.md` reflects the same completion state as the verification artifact, and all URs show supporting evidence or deliberate unresolved status in both files.</done>

<success_criteria>
- `08-VERIFICATION.md` exists with comprehensive requirement evidence mapping and three-source cross-check rows for UR-01..UR-04.
- Both Phase 08 summaries expose matching `requirements-completed` metadata listing UR-01..UR-04.
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` status rows agree with the verification artifact, maintaining fail-closed coverage.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/11-verification-backfill-for-upgrade-rebase/11-verification-backfill-for-upgrade-rebase-01-SUMMARY.md` summarizing the reconciliation.
