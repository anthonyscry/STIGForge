# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** Deterministic offline hardening missions with reusable manual evidence and defensible submission artifacts.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Canonical Ingestion Contracts

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Canonical Ingestion Contracts)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-20 - Roadmap rebooted for mission-console rewrite with strict SCAP mapping and offline-first constraints.

Progress: [----------] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: n/a
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 0 | 0 min | n/a |
| 2 | 0 | 0 min | n/a |
| 3 | 0 | 0 min | n/a |
| 4 | 0 | 0 min | n/a |
| 5 | 0 | 0 min | n/a |
| 6 | 0 | 0 min | n/a |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: none
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1] Contract-first ingestion remains the first delivery boundary to stabilize canonical data before execution modules.
- [Phase 2] Policy scope and safety gates stay separate from build/apply to keep review-required ambiguity and release-age blocking explicit.
- [Phase 4] Strict per-STIG SCAP mapping is treated as a hard invariant with no broad fallback permitted.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Need phase-plan decomposition under `.planning/phases/` before implementation work begins.
- Must preserve deterministic behavior across WPF/CLI mission-console surfaces when execution plans are created.
