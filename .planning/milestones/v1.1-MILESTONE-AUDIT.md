# Milestone Audit: v1.1

## Scope

- Milestone: `v1.1`
- Phase scope: `08`, `09`, `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`
- Integration checker model: `sonnet`
- Definition source: milestone context in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

## Phase Verification Coverage

| Phase | Plans | VERIFICATION status |
|---|---:|---|
| 08-upgrade-rebase-operator-workflow | 2/2 | passed |
| 09-wpf-parity-and-recovery-ux | 2/2 | passed |
| 10-quality-and-release-signal-hardening | 2/2 | passed |

| 12-wpf-parity-evidence-promotion-and-verification | 3/3 | passed |
| 13-mandatory-release-gate-enforcement-and-verification | 2/2 | passed |

Phase score: `6/6`.

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

All 10 v1.1 requirements are checked in REQUIREMENTS.md, mapped to a concrete phase, and satisfied by three-source closure evidence.

### UR requirements

| Req | Phase | Traceability | VERIFICATION | Summary metadata | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| UR-01 | 11 | Completed | `08-VERIFICATION.md` -> closed | `08` Plan summaries include `UR-01` | satisfied |
| UR-02 | 11 | Completed | `08-VERIFICATION.md` -> closed | `08` Plan summaries include `UR-02` | satisfied |
| UR-03 | 11 | Completed | `08-VERIFICATION.md` -> closed | `08` Plan summaries include `UR-03` | satisfied |
| UR-04 | 11 | Completed | `08-VERIFICATION.md` -> closed | `08` Plan summaries include `UR-04` | satisfied |

### WP requirements

| Req | Phase | Traceability | VERIFICATION | Summary metadata | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WP-01 | 12 | Completed | `09-VERIFICATION.md` -> closed | `09` Plan summaries include `WP-01` | satisfied |
| WP-02 | 12 | Completed | `09-VERIFICATION.md` -> closed | `09` Plan summaries include `WP-02` | satisfied |
| WP-03 | 12 | Completed | `09-VERIFICATION.md` -> closed | `09` Plan summaries include `WP-03` | satisfied |

### QA requirements

| Req | Phase | Traceability | VERIFICATION | Summary metadata | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QA-01 | 13 | Completed | `10-VERIFICATION.md` -> closed | `10` Plan summaries include `QA-01` | satisfied |
| QA-02 | 13 | Completed | `10-VERIFICATION.md` -> closed | `10` Plan summaries include `QA-02` | satisfied |
| QA-03 | 13 | Completed | `10-VERIFICATION.md` -> closed | `10` Plan summaries include `QA-03` | satisfied |

Requirement score: `10/10`.

## Cross-Phase Integration Findings

- `Test-ReleaseEvidenceContract.ps1` is now consumed consistently by CI, release-package, VM smoke, and package build paths.
- `release-package.yml` fails closed when `run_release_gate=false` with explicit `[disabled-check]` blocker.
- WPF parity contract evidence is emitted in `Invoke-ReleaseGate.ps1` and promoted into CI/release/package enforcement and packaging catalogs.
- No blocking integration gaps found. Integration score: `10/10`.

## E2E Flow Findings

- Source behavior to release evidence flow is wired: UR/WP implementation evidence in phases `08` and `09` is mapped in canonical phase verifications, reconciled in phase `11`/`12`/`13` closure artifacts, and enforced in release gates.
- QA and promotion flow does not report success when evidence proof is missing, failed, or disabled per contract semantics (`missing-proof`, `failed-check`, `disabled-check`).
- Human runtime checks remain useful references for final operational confirmation but no static flow breaks remain. Flow score: `3/3`.

## Verdict

Milestone audit status: **passed**.
