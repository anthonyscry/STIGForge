# Requirements: STIGForge v1.1 (Draft)

**Defined:** 2026-02-09
**Milestone:** v1.1 (planning initialization)
**Status:** Draft - awaiting final scope confirmation

## Core Value (Inherited)

Operators can execute a deterministic offline hardening mission flow with auditable outputs.

## Candidate Requirement Areas

### Workflow Completion

- [ ] **WF-01**: Define remaining operator-facing workflow gaps that block fully self-contained mission execution.
- [ ] **WF-02**: Define required parity checks between CLI and WPF flows for selected v1.1 scope.

### Upgrade/Rebase Operations

- [ ] **UR-01**: Define end-to-end operator workflow requirements for diff/rebase update handling.
- [ ] **UR-02**: Define user-facing diagnostics and recovery expectations for failed rebase paths.

### Quality and Stability

- [ ] **QS-01**: Define additional regression coverage needed for sustained quarterly release cycles.
- [ ] **QS-02**: Define measurable stability/quality gates for v1.1 promotion.
