# v1.1 Active TODO Snapshot

## Last updated

## Scope
Current execution activities covering remaining WP/QA requirement targets and v1.1 operational maturity MVP deliverables.

## Active TODOs
- [ ] [P1] WP-01: Expose diff/rebase workflow end-to-end within WPF without CLI fallback for standard operator paths. *(source: .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md:20-25)*
- [ ] [P1] WP-02: Align WPF status and mission summaries with CLI semantics for blocking failures, warnings, and optional skips. *(source: .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md:20-25)*
- [ ] [P2] WP-03: Surface actionable recovery guidance in WPF for failed apply/rebase paths (artifacts, next command, rollback guidance). *(source: .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md:20-25)*
- [ ] [P2] QA-01: Build deterministic automated coverage for diff/rebase core workflows and conflict handling in CI. *(source: .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md:26-31)*
- [ ] [P2] QA-02: Capture diff/rebase and WPF parity validation signals in VM/release gate evidence. *(source: .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md:26-31)*
- [ ] [P2] QA-03: Emit stability and compatibility trend artifacts that flag regression drift before promotion. *(source: .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md:26-31)*
- [ ] [P1] 80% line coverage on critical assemblies to establish quality gate baseline. *(source: .planning/research/FEATURES-v1.1-MATURITY.md:130-136)*
- [ ] [P1] Structured logging with correlation IDs to lay observability foundation. *(source: .planning/research/FEATURES-v1.1-MATURITY.md:132-136)*
- [ ] [P2] Human-readable error messages for clearer operator guidance. *(source: .planning/research/FEATURES-v1.1-MATURITY.md:132-136)*
- [ ] [P2] Mission time baselines that set predictable execution expectations. *(source: .planning/research/FEATURES-v1.1-MATURITY.md:132-136)*
- [ ] [P2] Test isolation (fix BuildHost_UsesConfiguredPathBuilderForSerilogLogDirectory) to unblock coverage enforcement. *(source: .planning/research/FEATURES-v1.1-MATURITY.md:130-136)*

## Dependencies/Blockers
- Phase 12 execution is currently driven by `.planning/phases/12-wpf-parity-evidence-promotion-and-verification/12-01-PLAN.md`; WP requirements remain pending until its evidence and reconciliation outputs are completed. *(source: .planning/ROADMAP.md:94-108)*
- Coverage and observability MVPs depend on resolving the known flaky test before thresholds can be enforced. *(source: .planning/research/FEATURES-v1.1-MATURITY.md:130-136)*
