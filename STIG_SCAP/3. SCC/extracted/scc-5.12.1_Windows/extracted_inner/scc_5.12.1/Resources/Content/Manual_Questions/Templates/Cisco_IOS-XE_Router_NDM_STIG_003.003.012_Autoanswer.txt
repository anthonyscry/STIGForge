RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to generate an alert for all audit failure events.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the Cisco router configuration to verify that it is compliant with this requirement as shown in the example below.

logging trap critical

Note: The parameter "critical" can replaced with a lesser severity level (i.e. error, warning, notice, informational). Informational is the default severity level; hence, if the severity level is configured to informational, the logging trap command will not be shown in the configuration.

If the Cisco router is not configured to generate an alert for all audit failure events, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to back up the configuration when changes occur.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the Cisco router configuration to verify that it is compliant with this requirement. The example configuration below will send the configuration to a SCP server when a configuration change occurs.

event manager applet BACKUP_CONFIG
 event syslog pattern "%SYS-5-CONFIG_I"
 action 1 info type routername
 action 2 cli command "enable"
 action 3 cli command "copy run scp" pattern "remote host"
 action 4 cli command "x.x.x.x" pattern "filename"
 action 5 cli command "$_info_routername-config"
 action 6 syslog priority informational msg "Configuration backup was executed"

If the Cisco router is not configured to conduct backups of the configuration when changes occur, this is a finding.

QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.iosxe:question:7901
RULE             : The Cisco router must be configured to obtain its public key certificates from an appropriate certificate policy through an approved service provider.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the router configuration to determine if a CA trust point has been configured. The CA trust point will contain the URL of the CA in which the router has enrolled with. Verify this is a DOD or DOD-approved CA. This will ensure the router has enrolled and received a certificate from a trusted CA. The CA trust point configuration would look similar to the example below.

crypto pki trustpoint CA_X
 enrollment url http://trustpoint1.example.com

Note: A remote end-point's certificate will always be validated by the router by verifying the signature of the CA on the certificate using the CA's public key, which is contained in the router's certificate it received at enrollment.

Note: This requirement is not applicable if the router does not have any public key certificates.

If the Cisco router is not configured to obtain its public key certificates from an appropriate certificate policy through an approved service provider, this is a finding.
