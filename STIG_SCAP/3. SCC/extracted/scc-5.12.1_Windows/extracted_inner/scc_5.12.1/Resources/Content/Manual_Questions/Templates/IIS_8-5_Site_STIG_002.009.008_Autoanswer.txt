RULE             : The IIS 8.5 website must use a logging mechanism that is configured to allocate log record storage capacity large enough to accommodate the logging requirements of the IIS 8.5 website.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Follow the procedures below for each site hosted on the IIS 8.5 web server:

Access the IIS 8.5 web server IIS 8.5 Manager.

Under "IIS" double-click on the "Logging" icon.

In the "Logging" configuration box, determine the "Directory:" to which the "W3C" logging is being written.

Confirm with the System Administrator that the designated log path is of sufficient size to maintain the logging.

Under "Log File Rollover", verify the "Do not create new log files" is not selected.

Verify a schedule is configured to rollover log files on a regular basis.

Consult with the System Administrator to determine if there is a documented process for moving the log files off of the IIS 8.5 web server to another logging device.

If the designated logging path device is not of sufficient space to maintain all log files and there is not a schedule to rollover files on a regular basis, this is a finding.

RULE             : The required DoD banner page must be displayed to authenticated users accessing a DoD private website.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: This requirement is only applicable for private DoD websites.

If a banner is required, the following banner page must be in place: 

“You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only. 

By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions: 

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations. 

- At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS. 

- Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose. 

- This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests—not for your personal benefit or privacy. 

- Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.” 

OR 

If your system cannot meet the character limits to store this amount of text in the banner, the following is another option for the warning banner: 

"I've read & consent to terms in IS user agreem't." 

NOTE: While DoDI 8500.01 does not contain a copy of the banner to be used, it does point to the RMF Knowledge Service for a copy of the required text. It is also noted that the banner is to be displayed only once when the individual enters the site and not for each page. 

If the access-controlled website does not display this banner page before entry, this is a finding.
