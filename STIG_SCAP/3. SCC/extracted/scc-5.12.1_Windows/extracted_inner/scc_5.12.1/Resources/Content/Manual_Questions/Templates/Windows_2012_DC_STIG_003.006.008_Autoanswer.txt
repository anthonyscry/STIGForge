RULE             : Active Directory Group Policy objects must have proper access control permissions.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the permissions on Group Policy objects.

Open "Group Policy Management".  (Available from various menus or run "gpmc.msc".)
Navigate to "Group Policy Objects" in the domain being reviewed (Forest > Domains > Domain). 

For each Group Policy object: 
Select the Group Policy object item in the left pane.
Select the Delegation tab in the right pane.
Select the Advanced button.

If any standard user accounts or groups have greater than Allow permissions of Read and Apply group policy, this is a finding.  

Other access permissions that allow the objects to be updated are considered findings unless specifically documented by the ISSO.

The default permissions noted below meet this requirement. 

The permissions shown are at the summary level.  More detailed permissions can be viewed by selecting the next Advanced button, selecting the desired Permission entry, and the Edit button.

Authenticated Users - Read, Apply group policy, Special permissions

The Special permissions for Authenticated Users are for Read type Properties.  If detailed permissions include any Create, Delete, Modify, or Write Permissions or Properties, this is a finding.

The Special permissions for the following default groups are not the focus of this requirement and may include a wide range of permissions and properties.

CREATOR OWNER - Special permissions

SYSTEM - Read, Write, Create all child objects, Delete all child objects, Special permissions

Domain Admins - Read, Write, Create all child objects, Delete all child objects, Special permissions

Enterprise Admins - Read, Write, Create all child objects, Delete all child objects, Special permissions

ENTERPRISE DOMAIN CONTROLLERS - Read, Special permissions

The Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins will not have the "Delete all child objects" permission on the two default group policy objects: Default Domain Policy and Default Domain Controllers Policy.  They will have this permission on created group policy objects.

The Anonymous Logon, Guests, or any group that contains those groups (in which users are not uniquely identified and authenticated) must not have any access permissions unless the group and justification is explicitly documented with the ISSO.

There are multiple sources from which lists of valid DoD CAs and approved ECAs can be obtained: 

The Global Directory Service (GDS) website provides an online source. The address for this site is https://crl.gds.disa.mil.

DoD Public Key Enablement (PKE) Engineering Support maintains the InstallRoot utility to manage DoD supported root certificates on Windows computers which includes a list of authorized CAs.  The utility package can be downloaded from the PKI and PKE Tools page on IASE.

RULE             : PKI certificates associated with user accounts must be issued by the DoD PKI or an approved External Certificate Authority (ECA).
QUESTION_TEXT    : Open "PowerShell" as Administrator.

Enter "Get-ADUser -Filter * | FT Name, UserPrincipalName, Enabled -AutoSize".

Review the User Principal Name (UPN) of user accounts, including administrators. 

Exclude the built-in accounts such as Administrator and Guest.

If the User Principal Name (UPN) is not in the format of an individual's identifier for the certificate type and for the appropriate domain suffix, this is a finding.

For standard NIPRNET certificates the individual's identifier is in the format of an Electronic Data Interchange - Personnel Identifier (EDI-PI).

Alt Tokens and other certificates may use a different UPN format than the EDI-PI, which vary by organization.  Verify these with the organization.

NIPRNET Example: 
Name - User Principal Name
User1 - 1234567890@mil

See PKE documentation for other network domain suffixes.

If the mappings are to certificates issued by a CA authorized by the Component's CIO, this is a CAT II finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs.

If an application allowlisting program is not in use on the system, this is a finding.

Configuration of allowlisting applications will vary by the program.

AppLocker is an allowlisting application built into Windows Server 2012. A deny-by-default implementation is initiated by enabling any AppLocker rules within a category, only allowing what is specified by defined rules.

If AppLocker is used, perform the following to view the configuration of AppLocker:
Open PowerShell.

If the AppLocker PowerShell module has not been previously imported, execute the following first:
Import-Module AppLocker

Execute the following command, substituting [c:\temp\file.xml] with a location and file name appropriate for the system:
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML > c:\temp\file.xml

This will produce an xml file with the effective settings that can be viewed in a browser or opened in a program such as Excel for review.

Implementation guidance for AppLocker is available at the following link:

RULE             : Data files owned by users must be on a different logical partition from the directory server data files.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Refer to the AD database location obtained in check V-8316.  Note the logical drive (e.g., C:) on which the files are located.

Determine if the server is currently providing file sharing services to users with the following command.
Enter "net share" at a command prompt.

Note the logical drive(s) or file system partition for any site-created data shares.
Ignore all system shares (e.g., Windows NETLOGON, SYSVOL, and administrative shares ending in $). User shares that are hidden (ending with $) should not be ignored.

If user shares are located on the same logical partition as the directory server data files, this is a finding.

RULE             : Time synchronization must be enabled on the domain controller.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Determine if a time synchronization tool has been implemented on the Windows domain controller.

If  the Windows Time Service is used, verify the following registry values.  If they are not configured as specified, this is a finding.

Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

Registry Path: \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient\

Registry Path: \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\
Value Name: Type
Type: REG_SZ
Value: NT5DS (preferred), NTP or Allsync

If these Windows checks indicate a finding because the NtpClient is not enabled, determine if an alternate time synchronization tool is installed and enabled.

If the Windows Time Service is not enabled and no alternate tool is enabled, this is a finding.

QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.windows:question:9901
RULE             : The directory server supporting (directly or indirectly) system access or resource authorization must run on a machine dedicated to that function.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Review the roles and services the domain controller is running.
Run "services.msc" to display the Services console.

Determine if any running services are application components.

Examples of services indicating the presence of applications are: 
-DHCP Server for DHCP server
-IIS Admin Service for IIS web server
-Microsoft Exchange System Attendant for Exchange
-MSSQLServer for SQL Server.

If any application-related components have the "Started" status, this is a finding.

Installed roles can be displayed by viewing Server Roles in the Add (or Remove) Roles and Features wizard.  (Cancel before any changes are made.)

Determine if any additional server roles are installed.  A basic domain controller set up will include the following:
-Active Directory Domain Services
-DNS Server
-File and Storage Services

If any roles not requiring installation on a domain controller are installed, this is a finding. 

Supplemental Notes:
A Domain Name System (DNS) server integrated with the directory server (e.g., AD-integrated DNS) is an acceptable application.  However, the DNS server must comply with the DNS STIG security requirements.

Some directory servers utilize specialized web servers for administrative functions and databases for data management.  These web and database servers are permitted as long as they are dedicated to directory server support and only administrative users have access to them.

RULE             : Necessary services must be documented to maintain a baseline to determine if additional, unnecessary services have been added to a system.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Required services will vary between organizations, and on the role of the individual system.  Organizations will develop their own list of services which will be documented and justified with the ISSO.  The site's list will be provided for any security review.  Services common to multiple systems can be addressed in one document.  Exceptions for individual systems should be identified separately by system.

Individual services specifically required to be disabled per the STIG are identified in separate requirements.

If the site has not documented the services required for their system(s), this is a finding.

The following can be used to view the services on a system:
Run "Services.msc".

Services for Windows Server 2012 roles are managed automatically, adding those necessary for a particular role.  The following lists the default services for a baseline installation as a reference. This can be used as a basis for documenting the services necessary.

RULE             : Security configuration tools or equivalent processes must be used to configure and maintain platforms for security compliance.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify security configuration tools or equivalent processes are being used to configure Windows systems to meet security requirements.  If security configuration tools or equivalent processes are not used, this is a finding.

Security configuration tools that are integrated into Windows, such as Group Policies and Security Templates, may be used to configure platforms for security compliance.

If an alternate method is used to configure a system (e.g., manually using the DISA Windows Security STIGs, etc.) and the same configured result is achieved, this is acceptable.

RULE             : The time service must synchronize with an appropriate DoD time source.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Open "Windows PowerShell" or an elevated "Command Prompt" (run as administrator).

Enter "W32tm /query /configuration".

Domain-joined systems are automatically configured with a "Type" of "NT5DS" to synchronize with domain controllers and would not be a finding.

If systems are configured with a "Type" of "NTP", including standalone systems and the forest root domain controller with the PDC Emulator role, and do not have a DoD time server defined for "NTPServer", this is a finding. (See V-8557 in the Active Directory Forest STIG for the time source requirement of the forest root domain PDC emulator.)

If an alternate time synchronization tool is used and is not enabled or not configured to synchronize with a DoD time source, this is a finding.

The US Naval Observatory operates stratum 1 time servers, which are identified at:
https://www.cnmoc.usff.navy.mil/Organization/United-States-Naval-Observatory/Precise-Time-Department/Network-Time-Protocol-NTP/

Time synchronization will occur through a hierarchy of time servers down to the local level. Clients and lower-level servers will synchronize with an authorized time server in the hierarchy.
