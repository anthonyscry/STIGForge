QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.server:question:1901
RULE             : The Windows DNS Server with a caching name server role must restrict recursive query responses to only the IP addresses and IP address ranges of known supported clients.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: Sinkhole name servers host records that are manually added and for which the name server is not authoritative. It is configured and intended to block resolvers from reaching a destination by directing the query to a sinkhole. If the sinkhole name server is not authoritative for any zones and serves only as a caching/forwarding name server, this check is not applicable.

The non-Active Directory (AD)-integrated, standalone, caching Windows DNS Server must be configured to be DNSSEC aware. When performing caching and lookups, the caching name server must be able to obtain a zone signing key (ZSK) DNSKEY record and corresponding RRSIG record for the queried record. It will use this information to compute the hash for the hostname being resolved. The caching name server decrypts the RRSIG record for the hostname being resolved with the zone's ZSK to get the RRSIG record hash. The caching name server compares the hashes and ensures they match.

If the non-AD-integrated, standalone, caching Windows DNS Server is not configured to be DNSSEC aware, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Windows DNS Server's zone files must have NS records that point to active name servers authoritative for the domain specified in that record.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: This check is not applicable if Windows DNS Server is only serving as a caching server and does not host any zones authoritatively.

Log on to the DNS server using the Domain Admin or Enterprise Admin account or Local Administrator account.

Press the Windows key + R and execute "dnsmgmt.msc".

On the opened DNS Manager snap-in from the left pane, expand the server name for the DNS server and then expand "Forward Lookup Zones".

From the expanded list, click to select the zone.

Review the NS records for the zone.

Verify each of the name servers, represented by the NS records, is active.

At a command prompt on any system, type:

nslookup <enter>;

At the nslookup prompt, type: 

server ###.###.###.### <enter>;
(where the ###.###.###.### is replaced by the IP of each NS record) 

Enter a FQDN for a known host record in the zone.

If the NS server does not respond at all or responds with a nonauthoritative answer, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Windows DNS Server must notify the DNS administrator in the event of an error validating another DNS server's identity.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Windows DNS Servers hosting Active Directory (AD)-integrated zones transfer zone information via AD replication. Windows DNS Servers hosting non-AD-integrated zones as a secondary name server and/or not hosting AD-integrated zones use zone transfer to sync zone data.

If the Windows DNS Server hosts only AD-integrated zones and all other name servers for the zones hosted are Active Directory Domain Controllers, this requirement is not applicable.

If the Windows DNS Server is not an Active Directory Domain Controller or is a secondary name server for a zone with a non-AD-integrated name server as the master, this requirement is applicable.

Administrator notification is only possible if a third-party event monitoring system is configured or, at a minimum, there are documented procedures requiring the administrator to review the DNS logs on a routine, daily basis.

If a third-party event monitoring system is not configured or a document procedure is not in place requiring the administrator to review the DNS logs on a routine, daily basis, this is a finding.

RULE             : Forwarders on an authoritative Windows DNS Server, if enabled for external resolution, must forward only to an internal, non-Active Directory (AD)-integrated DNS server or to the DOD Enterprise Recursive Services (ERS).
QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: If the Windows DNS Server is in the classified network, this check is not applicable. If forwarders are not being used, this is not applicable.

Note: In Windows DNS Server, if forwarders are configured, the recursion setting must also be enabled because disabling recursion will disable forwarders.

If forwarders are not used, recursion must be disabled. In both cases, the use of root hints must be disabled.

Log on to the DNS server using the Domain Admin or Enterprise Admin account or Local Administrator account.

Press the Windows key + R and execute "dnsmgmt.msc".

On the opened DNS Manager snap-in from the left pane, right-click on the server name for the DNS server and select "Properties".

From the expanded list, click to select the zone.
 
Confirm with the DNS administrator that the hosts defined in the zone files do not resolve to hosts in another zone with its fully qualified domain name.

The exceptions are glue records supporting zone delegations, CNAME records supporting a system migration, or CNAME records that point to third-party CDNs or cloud computing platforms. In the case of third-party CDNs or cloud offerings, an approved mission need must be demonstrated. Additional exceptions are CNAME records in a multidomain Active Directory environment pointing to hosts in other internal domains in the same multidomain environment.

If resource records are maintained that resolve to a fully qualified domain name in another zone, and the usage is not for resource records resolving to hosts that are glue records supporting zone delegations, CNAME records supporting a system migration, or CNAME records that point to third-party CDNs or cloud computing platforms with a documented and approved mission need, this is a finding.

Additional exceptions are CNAME records in a multidomain Active Directory environment pointing to hosts in other internal domains in the same multidomain environment.

If there are zone-spanning (i.e., zones of lesser security) CNAME records older than six months and the CNAME records resolve to anything other than fully qualified domain names for glue records supporting zone delegations, CNAME records supporting a system migration, or CNAME records that point to third-party CDNs or cloud computing platforms with an AO-approved and documented mission need, this is a finding.

RULE             : The private key corresponding to the zone signing key (ZSK) must only be stored on the name server that does support dynamic updates.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: This check is not applicable for Windows DNS Servers that host only Active Directory (AD)-integrated zones or for Windows DNS Servers on a classified network.

Note: This requirement is not applicable to servers with only a caching role.

For AD-integrated zones, private zone signing keys replicate automatically to all primary DNS servers through AD replication. Each authoritative server signs its own copy of the zone when it receives the key. For optimal performance, and to prevent increasing the size of the AD database file, the signed copy of the zone remains in memory for AD-integrated zones. A DNSSEC-signed zone is only committed to disk for file-backed zones. Secondary DNS servers pull a full copy of the zone, including signatures, from the primary DNS server.

If all DNS servers are AD integrated, this check is not applicable.

If a DNS server is not AD integrated and has file-backed zones, does not accept dynamic updates, and has a copy of the private key corresponding to the ZSK, this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: This check is not applicable for Windows DNS Servers that host only Active Directory-integrated zones or for Windows DNS Servers on a classified network.

In Windows, the NSEC3 salt values are automatically changed when the zone is re-signed.

To validate:
Log on to the DNS server using the Domain Admin or Enterprise Admin account or Local Administrator account.

Press the Windows key + R and execute "dnsmgmt.msc".

On the opened DNS Manager snap-in from the left pane, expand the server name for the DNS Server and then expand "Forward Lookup Zones".

Review the zone's RRs in the right windowpane.

Determine the RRSIG NSEC3PARAM's Inception (in the Data column). Compare the Inception to the RRSIG DNSKEY Inception. The date and time should be the same.

If the NSEC3PARAM's Inception date and time is different than the DNSKEY Inception date and time, this is a finding.

RULE             : The Windows DNS Server must be configured to validate an authentication chain of parent and child domains via response data.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: This check is not applicable for Windows DNS Servers that host only Active Directory-integrated zones or for Windows DNS Servers on a classified network.

Validate this check from the Windows DNS Server being configured/reviewed.

Log on to the Windows DNS Server using the account designated as Administrator or DNS Administrator.

Determine a valid host in the zone.

Open the Windows PowerShell prompt on the Windows DNS Server being configured/reviewed.

Issue the following command:

PS C:\> Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName adatum.com -RRType DS

Replace "adatum.com" with the parent zone on the DNS server being evaluated.

HostName RecordType Timestamp TimeToLive RecordData
-------- ---------- --------- ---------- ----------
corp DS 0 01:00:00 [58555][Sha1][RsaSha1NSec3]
corp DS 0 01:00:00 [58555][Sha256][RsaSha1NSec3]
corp DS 0 01:00:00 [63513][Sha1][RsaSha1NSec3]
corp DS 0 01:00:00 [63513][Sha256][RsaSha1NSec3]

If the results do not show the DS records for the child domain(s), this is a finding.

In the previous example, DS records for the child zone, corp.adatum.com, were imported into the parent zone, adatum.com, by using the DSSET file in the c:\windows\system32\dns directory. The DSSET file was located in this directory because the local DNS server is the Key primary for the child zone.

If the Key Master DNS server for a child zone is not the same computer as the primary authoritative DNS server for the parent zone where the DS record is being added, the DSSET file must be obtained for the child zone and made available to the primary authoritative server for the parent zone. Alternatively, the DS records can be added manually.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Note: If the only zones hosted are AD-integrated zones, this check is not applicable.

Notification to the system administrator is not configurable in Windows. For the administrator to be notified if functionality of DNSSEC/TSIG has been removed or broken, the information system security officer (ISSO), information system security manager (ISSM), or DNS administrator would need to implement a third-party monitoring system. At a minimum, the ISSO/ISSM/DNS administrator should have a documented procedure in place to review the diagnostic logs on a routine basis every day.
