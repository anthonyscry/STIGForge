RULE             : The operating system must employ a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs.

If an application allowlisting program is not in use on the system, this is a finding.

Configuration of allowlisting applications will vary by the program.

AppLocker is an allowlisting application built into Windows Server 2012. A deny-by-default implementation is initiated by enabling any AppLocker rules within a category, only allowing what is specified by defined rules.

If AppLocker is used, perform the following to view the configuration of AppLocker:
Open PowerShell.

If the AppLocker PowerShell module has not been previously imported, execute the following first:
Import-Module AppLocker

Execute the following command, substituting [c:\temp\file.xml] with a location and file name appropriate for the system:
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML > c:\temp\file.xml

This will produce an xml file with the effective settings that can be viewed in a browser or opened in a program such as Excel for review.

Implementation guidance for AppLocker is available at the following link:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-policies-deployment-guide

RULE             : Software certificate installation files must be removed from Windows 2012/2012 R2.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Search all drives for *.p12 and *.pfx files.

If any files with these extensions exist, this is a finding.

This does not apply to server-based applications that have a requirement for certificate files or Adobe PreFlight certificate files. Some applications create files with extensions of .p12 that are not certificate installation files. Removal of non-certificate installation files from systems is not required. These must be documented with the ISSO.

RULE             : Necessary services must be documented to maintain a baseline to determine if additional, unnecessary services have been added to a system.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Required services will vary between organizations, and on the role of the individual system.  Organizations will develop their own list of services which will be documented and justified with the ISSO.  The site's list will be provided for any security review.  Services common to multiple systems can be addressed in one document.  Exceptions for individual systems should be identified separately by system.

Individual services specifically required to be disabled per the STIG are identified in separate requirements.

If the site has not documented the services required for their system(s), this is a finding.

The following can be used to view the services on a system:
Run "Services.msc".

Services for Windows Server 2012 roles are managed automatically, adding those necessary for a particular role.  The following lists the default services for a baseline installation as a reference. This can be used as a basis for documenting the services necessary.

If the HIPS component of ESS is installed and active on the host and the Alerts of blocked activity are being logged and monitored, this will meet the requirement of this finding. 

A HID device is not required on a system that has the role as the Network Intrusion Device (NID). However, this exception needs to be documented with the site ISSO.

If a host-based Intrusion Detection System is not installed on the system, this is a finding.

QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify DoD-approved ESS software is installed and properly operating. Ask the site ISSM for documentation of the ESS software installation and configuration.

If the ISSM is not able to provide a documented configuration for an installed ESS or if the ESS software is not properly maintained or used, this is a finding.

Note: Example of documentation can be a copy of the site's CCB approved Software Baseline with version of software noted or a memo from the ISSM stating current ESS software and version.

QUESTION_TEXT    : If FTP is not installed on the system, this is NA.

Determine the IP address and port number assigned to FTP sites from documentation or configuration.

If Microsoft FTP is used, open "Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager".

Select "Sites" under the server name.

For any sites that reference FTP, view the Binding information for IP address and port.  The standard port for FTP is 21, however this may be changed.

Open a "Command Prompt".

Attempt to log on as the user "anonymous" with the following commands:

Note: Returned results may vary depending on the FTP server software.

C:\> "ftp"
ftp> "Open IP Address Port"
(Substituting [IP Address] and [Port] with the information previously identified.  If no IP Address was listed in the Binding, attempt using "localhost".)
(Connected to IP Address
220 Microsoft FTP Service)

User (IP Address): "anonymous"
(331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.)

Password: "password"
(230 User logged in.)
ftp>

If the response indicates that an anonymous FTP login was permitted, this is a finding.

If accounts with administrator privileges are used to access FTP, this is a CAT I finding.

RULE             : Security configuration tools or equivalent processes must be used to configure and maintain platforms for security compliance.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify security configuration tools or equivalent processes are being used to configure Windows systems to meet security requirements.  If security configuration tools or equivalent processes are not used, this is a finding.

Security configuration tools that are integrated into Windows, such as Group Policies and Security Templates, may be used to configure platforms for security compliance.

If an alternate method is used to configure a system (e.g., manually using the DISA Windows Security STIGs, etc.) and the same configured result is achieved, this is acceptable.

RULE             : The time service must synchronize with an appropriate DoD time source.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Open "Windows PowerShell" or an elevated "Command Prompt" (run as administrator).

Enter "W32tm /query /configuration".

Domain-joined systems are automatically configured with a "Type" of "NT5DS" to synchronize with domain controllers and would not be a finding.

If systems are configured with a "Type" of "NTP", including standalone systems and the forest root domain controller with the PDC Emulator role, and do not have a DoD time server defined for "NTPServer", this is a finding. (See V-8557 in the Active Directory Forest STIG for the time source requirement of the forest root domain PDC emulator.)

If an alternate time synchronization tool is used and is not enabled or not configured to synchronize with a DoD time source, this is a finding.

The US Naval Observatory operates stratum 1 time servers, which are identified at:
https://www.cnmoc.usff.navy.mil/Organization/United-States-Naval-Observatory/Precise-Time-Department/Network-Time-Protocol-NTP/

Time synchronization will occur through a hierarchy of time servers down to the local level. Clients and lower-level servers will synchronize with an authorized time server in the hierarchy.

RULE             : Outdated or unused accounts must be removed from the system or disabled.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Run "PowerShell".

Member servers and standalone systems:
Copy or enter the lines below to the PowerShell window and enter. (Entering twice may be required. Do not include the quotes at the beginning and end of the query.)

"([ADSI]('WinNT://{0}' -f $env:COMPUTERNAME)).Children | Where { $_.SchemaClassName -eq 'user' } | ForEach {

}"

This will return a list of local accounts with the account name, last logon, and if the account is enabled (True/False).
For example: User1 10/31/2015 5:49:56 AM True

Domain Controllers:
Enter the following command in PowerShell.
"Search-ADAccount -AccountInactive -UsersOnly -TimeSpan 35.00:00:00"

This will return accounts that have not been logged on to for 35 days, along with various attributes such as the Enabled status and LastLogonDate.
