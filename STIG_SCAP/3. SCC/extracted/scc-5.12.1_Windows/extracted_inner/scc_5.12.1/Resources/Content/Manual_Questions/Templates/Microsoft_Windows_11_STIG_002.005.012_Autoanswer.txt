RULE             : Administrative accounts must not be used with applications that access the internet, such as web browsers, or with potential internet sources, such as email.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Determine whether administrative accounts are prevented from using applications that access the internet, such as web browsers, or with potential internet sources, such as email, except as necessary for local service administration.

The organization must have a policy that prohibits administrative accounts from using applications that access the internet, such as web browsers, or with potential internet sources, such as email, except as necessary for local service administration. The policy must define specific exceptions for local service administration. These exceptions may include HTTP(S)-based tools that are used for the administration of the local system, services, or attached devices.

Technical measures such as the removal of applications or application allowlisting must be used where feasible to prevent the use of applications that access the internet. 

If accounts with administrative privileges are not prevented from using applications that access the internet or with potential internet sources, this is a finding.

QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.windows11:question:901
RULE             : Windows 11 must employ automated mechanisms to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency: Continuously, where ESS is used; 30 days, for any additional internal network scans not covered by ESS; and annually, for external scans by Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP).
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify DOD-approved ESS software is installed and properly operating. Ask the site information system security manager (ISSM) for documentation of the ESS software installation and configuration.

If the ISSM is not able to provide a documented configuration for an installed ESS or if the ESS software is not properly maintained or used, this is a finding.

Note: Example of documentation can be a copy of the site's CCB approved Software Baseline with version of software noted or a memo from the ISSM stating current ESS software and version.

QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.windows11:question:1701
RULE             : The operating system must employ a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs. This must include packaged apps such as the universal apps installed by default on systems.

If an application allowlisting program is not in use on the system, this is a finding.

Configuration of allowlisting applications will vary by the program.

AppLocker is an allowlisting application built into Windows 11 Enterprise. A deny-by-default implementation is initiated by enabling any AppLocker rules within a category, only allowing what is specified by defined rules.

If AppLocker is used, perform the following to view the configuration of AppLocker:
Run "PowerShell".

Execute the following command, substituting [c:\temp\file.xml] with a location and file name appropriate for the system:
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML > c:\temp\file.xml

This will produce an xml file with the effective settings that can be viewed in a browser or opened in a program such as Excel for review.

Implementation guidance for AppLocker is available at the following link:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-policies-deployment-guide

RULE             : Only authorized user accounts must be allowed to create or run virtual machines on Windows 11 systems.
QUESTION_TEXT    : If a hosted hypervisor (Hyper-V, VMware Workstation, etc.) is installed on the system, verify only authorized user accounts are allowed to run virtual machines.

For Hyper-V, run "Computer Management".
Navigate to System Tools >> Local Users and Groups >> Groups.
Double click on "Hyper-V Administrators".

If any unauthorized groups or user accounts are listed in "Members:", this is a finding.

For hosted hypervisors other than Hyper-V, verify only authorized user accounts have access to run the virtual machines. Restrictions may be enforced by access to the physical system, software restriction policies, or access restrictions built into the application.

If any unauthorized groups or user accounts have access to create or run virtual machines, this is a finding.

All users authorized to create or run virtual machines must be documented with the ISSM/ISSO. Accounts nested within group accounts must be documented as individual accounts and not the group accounts.

RULE             : Windows 11 must cover or disable the built-in or attached camera when not in use.
QUESTION_TEXT    : If the device or operating system does not have a camera installed, this requirement is not applicable.

This requirement is not applicable to mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), where the use of the camera is a local authorizing official (AO) decision.

This requirement is not applicable to dedicated VTC suites located in approved VTC locations that are centrally managed.

For an external camera, if there is not a method for the operator to manually disconnect camera at the end of collaborative computing sessions, this is a finding.

For a built-in camera, the camera must be protected by a camera cover (e.g. laptop camera cover slide) when not in use. If the built-in camera is not protected with a camera cover, or if the built-in
camera is not disabled in the bios, this is a finding.

If the camera is not disconnected or covered, the following registry entry is required:

Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
RegistryPath\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore\webcam

Value Name: Value                                                                             Value Data: Deny

If "Value Name" is set to a value other than "Deny" and the collaborative computing device has not been authorized for use, this is a finding.

RULE             : Unused accounts must be disabled or removed from the system after 35 days of inactivity.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Run "PowerShell".
Copy the lines below to the PowerShell window and enter.

"([ADSI]('WinNT://{0}' -f $env:COMPUTERNAME)).Children | Where { $_.SchemaClassName -eq 'user' } | ForEach {

  if ($lastLogin -eq $null) {
   $lastLogin = 'Never'
  }
  Write-Host $user.Name $lastLogin $enabled 
}"

This will return a list of local accounts with the account name, last logon, and if the account is enabled (True/False).
For example: User1 10/31/2015 5:49:56 AM True

Review the list to determine the finding validity for each account reported.

Exclude the following accounts:
Built-in administrator account (Disabled, SID ending in 500)
Built-in guest account (Disabled, SID ending in 501)
Built-in DefaultAccount (Disabled, SID ending in 503)
Local administrator account

If any enabled accounts have not been logged on to within the past 35 days, this is a finding.

Inactive accounts that have been reviewed and deemed to be required must be documented with the information system security officer (ISSO).
