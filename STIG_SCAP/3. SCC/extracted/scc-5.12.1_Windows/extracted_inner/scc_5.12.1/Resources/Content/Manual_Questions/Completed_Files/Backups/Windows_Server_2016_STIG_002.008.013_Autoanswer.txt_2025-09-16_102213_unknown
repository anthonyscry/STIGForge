RULE             : Directory data (outside the root DSE) of a non-public directory must be configured to prevent anonymous access.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This applies to domain controllers. It is NA for other systems.

Open "Command Prompt" (not elevated).

Run "ldp.exe".

From the "Connection menu", select "Bind".

Clear the User, Password, and Domain fields.

Select "Simple bind" for the Bind type and click "OK".

Confirmation of anonymous access will be displayed at the end:

res = ldap_simple_bind_s
Authenticated as: 'NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON'

From the "Browse" menu, select "Search".

In the Search dialog, enter the DN of the domain naming context (generally something like "dc=disaost,dc=mil") in the Base DN field.

Clear the Attributes field and select "Run".

Error messages should display related to Bind and user not authenticated.

If attribute data is displayed, anonymous access is enabled to the domain naming context and this is a finding.

The following network controls allow the finding severity to be downgraded to a CAT II since these measures lower the risk associated with anonymous access.

Network hardware ports at the site are subject to 802.1x authentication or MAC address restrictions. 

Premise firewall or host restrictions prevent access to ports 389, 636, 3268, and 3269 from client hosts not explicitly identified by domain (.mil) or IP address.

RULE             : Domain Controller PKI certificates must be issued by the DoD PKI or an approved External Certificate Authority (ECA).
QUESTION_TEXT    : This applies to domain controllers. It is NA for other systems.

Run "MMC".

Select "Add/Remove Snap-in" from the "File" menu.

Select "Certificates" in the left pane and click the "Add >" button.

Select "Computer Account" and click "Next".

Select the appropriate option for "Select the computer you want this snap-in to manage" and click "Finish".

Select and expand the Certificates (Local Computer) entry in the left pane.

Select and expand the Personal entry in the left pane.

Select the Certificates entry in the left pane.

In the right pane, examine the "Issued By" field for the certificate to determine the issuing CA.

If the "Issued By" field of the PKI certificate being used by the domain controller does not indicate the issuing CA is part of the DoD PKI or an approved ECA, this is a finding.

If the certificates in use are issued by a CA authorized by the Component's CIO, this is a CAT II finding.

There are multiple sources from which lists of valid DoD CAs and approved ECAs can be obtained: 

The Global Directory Service (GDS) website provides an online source. The address for this site is https://crl.gds.disa.mil.

DoD Public Key Enablement (PKE) Engineering Support maintains the InstallRoot utility to manage DoD supported root certificates on Windows computers, which includes a list of authorized CAs. The utility package can be downloaded from the PKI and PKE Tools page on IASE:

QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.windows:question:34301
RULE             : PKI certificates associated with user accounts must be issued by the DoD PKI or an approved External Certificate Authority (ECA).
QUESTION_TEXT    : This applies to domain controllers. It is NA for other systems.

Review user account mappings to PKI certificates.

Open "Windows PowerShell".

Enter "Get-ADUser -Filter * | FT Name, UserPrincipalName, Enabled".

Exclude disabled accounts (e.g., DefaultAccount, Guest) and the krbtgt account.

If the User Principal Name (UPN) is not in the format of an individual's identifier for the certificate type and for the appropriate domain suffix, this is a finding.

For standard NIPRNet certificates the individual's identifier is in the format of an Electronic Data Interchange - Personnel Identifier (EDI-PI).

Alt Tokens and other certificates may use a different UPN format than the EDI-PI which vary by organization. Verified these with the organization.

NIPRNet Example:
Name - User Principal Name
User1 - 1234567890@mil

See PKE documentation for other network domain suffixes.

If the mappings are to certificates issued by a CA authorized by the Component's CIO, this is a CAT II finding.

RULE             : Windows Server 2016 must employ a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs.

If an application allowlisting program is not in use on the system, this is a finding.

Configuration of allowlisting applications will vary by the program.

AppLocker is an allowlisting application built into Windows Server. A deny-by-default implementation is initiated by enabling any AppLocker rules within a category, only allowing what is specified by defined rules.

If AppLocker is used, perform the following to view the configuration of AppLocker:

Open "PowerShell".

If the AppLocker PowerShell module has not been imported previously, execute the following first:

Import-Module AppLocker

Execute the following command, substituting [c:\temp\file.xml] with a location and file name appropriate for the system:

Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML > c:\temp\file.xml

This will produce an xml file with the effective settings that can be viewed in a browser or opened in a program such as Excel for review.

Implementation guidance for AppLocker is available at the following link:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-policies-deployment-guide

RULE             : Outdated or unused accounts must be removed from the system or disabled.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Open "Windows PowerShell".

Domain Controllers:

Enter "Search-ADAccount -AccountInactive -UsersOnly -TimeSpan 35.00:00:00"

This will return accounts that have not been logged on to for 35 days, along with various attributes such as the Enabled status and LastLogonDate.

Member servers and standalone or nondomain-joined systems:

Copy or enter the lines below to the PowerShell window and enter. (Entering twice may be required. Do not include the quotes at the beginning and end of the query.)

"([ADSI]('WinNT://{0}' -f $env:COMPUTERNAME)).Children | Where { $_.SchemaClassName -eq 'user' } | ForEach {

 if ($lastLogin -eq $null) {
 $lastLogin = 'Never'
 }
 Write-Host $user.Name $lastLogin $enabled 
}"

This will return a list of local accounts with the account name, last logon, and if the account is enabled (True/False).
For example: User1 10/31/2015 5:49:56 AM True

Review the list of accounts returned by the above queries to determine the finding validity for each account reported.

Exclude the following accounts:

Open an elevated "Command Prompt" (run as administrator).

Enter "ntdsutil".

At the "ntdsutil:" prompt, enter "LDAP policies".

At the "ldap policy:" prompt, enter "connections".

At the "server connections:" prompt, enter "connect to server [host-name]"
(where [host-name] is the computer name of the domain controller).

At the "server connections:" prompt, enter "q".

At the "ldap policy:" prompt, enter "show values". 

If the value for MaxConnIdleTime is greater than "300" (5 minutes) or is not specified, this is a finding.

Enter "q" at the "ldap policy:" and "ntdsutil:" prompts to exit.

Alternately, Dsquery can be used to display MaxConnIdleTime:

Open "Command Prompt (Admin)".
Enter the following command (on a single line).

dsquery * "cn=Default Query Policy,cn=Query-Policies,cn=Directory Service, cn=Windows NT,cn=Services,cn=Configuration,dc=[forest-name]" -attr LDAPAdminLimits 

The quotes are required and dc=[forest-name] is the fully qualified LDAP name of the domain being reviewed (e.g., dc=disaost,dc=mil).

If the results do not specify a "MaxConnIdleTime" or it has a value greater than "300" (5 minutes), this is a finding.
