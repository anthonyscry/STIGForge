RULE             : Windows Server 2022 directory data (outside the root DSE) of a nonpublic directory must be configured to prevent anonymous access.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This applies to domain controllers. It is NA for other systems.

Open "Command Prompt" (not elevated).

Run "ldp.exe".

From the "Connection menu", select "Bind".

Clear the User, Password, and Domain fields.

Select "Simple bind" for the Bind type and click "OK".

Confirmation of anonymous access will be displayed at the end:

res = ldap_simple_bind_s
Authenticated as: 'NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON'

From the "Browse" menu, select "Search".

In the Search dialog, enter the DN of the domain naming context (generally something like "dc=disaost,dc=mil") in the Base DN field.

Clear the Attributes field and select "Run".

Error messages must display related to Bind and user not authenticated.

If attribute data is displayed, anonymous access is enabled to the domain naming context and this is a finding.

The following network controls allow the finding severity to be downgraded to a CAT II since these measures lower the risk associated with anonymous access.

Network hardware ports at the site are subject to 802.1x authentication or MAC address restrictions. 

Premise firewall or host restrictions prevent access to ports 389, 636, 3268, and 3269 from client hosts not explicitly identified by domain (.mil) or IP address.

RULE             : Windows Server 2022 domain Controller PKI certificates must be issued by the DoD PKI or an approved External Certificate Authority (ECA).
QUESTION_TEXT    : This applies to domain controllers. It is NA for other systems.

Run "MMC".

Select "Add/Remove Snap-in" from the "File" menu.

Select "Certificates" in the left pane and click "Add >".

Select "Computer Account" and click "Next".

Select the appropriate option for "Select the computer you want this snap-in to manage" and click "Finish".

Select and expand the Personal entry in the left pane.

Select the Certificates entry in the left pane.

In the right pane, examine the "Issued By" field for the certificate to determine the issuing CA.

If the "Issued By" field of the PKI certificate being used by the domain controller does not indicate the issuing CA is part of the DoD PKI or an approved ECA, this is a finding.

If the certificates in use are issued by a CA authorized by the Component's CIO, this is a CAT II finding.

There are multiple sources from which lists of valid DoD CAs and approved ECAs can be obtained: 

The Global Directory Service (GDS) website provides an online source. The address for this site is https://crl.gds.disa.mil.

DoD Public Key Enablement (PKE) Engineering Support maintains the InstallRoot utility to manage DoD supported root certificates on Windows computers, which includes a list of authorized CAs. The utility package can be downloaded from the PKI and PKE Tools page on Cyber Exchange:

RULE             : Windows Server 2022 PKI certificates associated with user accounts must be issued by a DoD PKI or an approved External Certificate Authority (ECA).
QUESTION_TEXT    : This applies to domain controllers. It is NA for other systems.

Review user account mappings to PKI certificates.

Open "Windows PowerShell".

Enter "Get-ADUser -Filter * | FT Name, UserPrincipalName, Enabled".

Exclude disabled accounts (e.g., DefaultAccount, Guest) and the krbtgt account.

If the User Principal Name (UPN) is not in the format of an individual's identifier for the certificate type and for the appropriate domain suffix, this is a finding.

For standard NIPRNet certificates, the individual's identifier is in the format of an Electronic Data Interchange - Personnel Identifier (EDI-PI).

Alt Tokens and other certificates may use a different UPN format than the EDI-PI which vary by organization. Verified these with the organization.

NIPRNet Example:

Name - User Principal Name
User1 - 1234567890@mil

See PKE documentation for other network domain suffixes.

If the mappings are to certificates issued by a CA authorized by the Component's CIO, this is a CAT II finding.

RULE             : Windows Server 2022 must employ a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Verify the operating system employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs.

If an application allowlisting program is not in use on the system, this is a finding.

Configuration of allowlisting applications will vary by the program.

AppLocker is an allowlisting application built in to Windows Server. A deny-by-default implementation is initiated by enabling any AppLocker rules within a category, only allowing what is specified by defined rules.

If AppLocker is used, perform the following to view the configuration of AppLocker:

Open "PowerShell".

If the AppLocker PowerShell module has not been imported previously, execute the following first:

Import-Module AppLocker

Execute the following command, substituting [c:\temp\file.xml] with a location and file name appropriate for the system:

Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective -XML > c:\temp\file.xml

This will produce an xml file with the effective settings that can be viewed in a browser or opened in a program such as Excel for review.

Implementation guidance for AppLocker is available at the following link:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-policies-deployment-guide

RULE             : Windows Server 2022 domain controllers must run on a machine dedicated to that function.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This applies to domain controllers, it is NA for other systems.

Review the installed roles the domain controller is supporting.

Start "Server Manager".

Select "AD DS" in the left pane and the server name under "Servers" to the right.

Select "Add (or Remove) Roles and Features" from "Tasks" in the "Roles and Features" section. (Cancel before any changes are made.)

- DNS Server
- File and Storage Services

If any roles not requiring installation on a domain controller are installed, this is a finding. 

A Domain Name System (DNS) server integrated with the directory server (e.g., AD-integrated DNS) is an acceptable application. However, the DNS server must comply with the DNS STIG security requirements.

Run "Programs and Features".

Review installed applications.

If any applications are installed that are not required for the domain controller, this is a finding.

RULE             : Windows Server 2022 directory service must be configured to terminate LDAP-based network connections to the directory server after five minutes of inactivity.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This applies to domain controllers. It is NA for other systems.

Open an elevated "Command Prompt" (run as administrator).

Enter "ntdsutil".

At the "ntdsutil:" prompt, enter "LDAP policies".

At the "ldap policy:" prompt, enter "connections".

At the "server connections:" prompt, enter "connect to server [host-name]"
(where [host-name] is the computer name of the domain controller).

At the "server connections:" prompt, enter "q".

At the "ldap policy:" prompt, enter "show values". 

If the value for MaxConnIdleTime is greater than "300" (5 minutes) or is not specified, this is a finding.

Enter "q" at the "ldap policy:" and "ntdsutil:" prompts to exit.

Alternately, Dsquery can be used to display MaxConnIdleTime:

Open "Command Prompt (Admin)".
Enter the following command (on a single line).

dsquery * "cn=Default Query Policy,cn=Query-Policies,cn=Directory Service, cn=Windows NT,cn=Services,cn=Configuration,dc=[forest-name]" -attr LDAPAdminLimits 

The quotes are required and dc=[forest-name] is the fully qualified LDAP name of the domain being reviewed (e.g., dc=disaost,dc=mil).

If the results do not specify a "MaxConnIdleTime" or it has a value greater than "300" (5 minutes), this is a finding.
