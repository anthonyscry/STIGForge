RULE             : The IIS 8.5 web server must use a logging mechanism that is configured to allocate log record storage capacity large enough to accommodate the logging requirements of the IIS 8.5 web server.
QUESTION_TEXT    : Open the IIS 8.5 Manager.

Click the IIS 8.5 web server name.

Under "IIS" double-click on the "Logging" icon.

In the "Logging" configuration box, determine the "Directory:" to which the "W3C" logging is being written.

Confirm with the System Administrator that the designated log path is of sufficient size to maintain the logging.

Under "Log File Rollover", verify the "Do not create new log files" is not selected.

Verify a schedule is configured to rollover log files on a regular basis.

Consult with the System Administrator to determine if there is a documented process for moving the log files off of the IIS 8.5 web server to another logging device.
