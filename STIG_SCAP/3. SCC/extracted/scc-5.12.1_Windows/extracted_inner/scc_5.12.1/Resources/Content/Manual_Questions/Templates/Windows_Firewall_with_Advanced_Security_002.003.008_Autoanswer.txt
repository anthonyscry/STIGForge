RULE             : Inbound exceptions to the firewall on domain workstations must only allow authorized remote management hosts.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement is NA for servers and non domain workstations.

Verify firewall exceptions for inbound connections on domain workstations only allow authorized management systems and remote management hosts.

Review inbound firewall exception rules in Microsoft Defender Firewall with Advanced Security. Firewall rules can be complex and should be reviewed with the firewall administrator.

One method for restricting inbound connections is to only allow exceptions for a specific scope of remote IP addresses.

If allowed inbound exceptions are not limited to authorized management systems and remote management hosts, this is a finding.
