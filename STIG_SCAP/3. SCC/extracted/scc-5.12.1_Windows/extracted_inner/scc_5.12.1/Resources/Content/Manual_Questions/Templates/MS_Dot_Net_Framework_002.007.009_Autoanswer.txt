QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.dotnet:question:501
RULE             : Developer certificates used with the .NET Publisher Membership Condition must be approved by the ISSO.
QUESTION_TEXT    : The infrastructure to enable Code Access Security (CAS) exists only in .NET Framework 2.x-4.x. 

This requirement is Not Applicable (NA) for .NET Framework greater than 4.x.

(Note: The infrastructure is deprecated and is not receiving servicing or security fixes.)

Caspol.exe is a Microsoft tool used for working with .Net policy. Use caspol.exe to list the code groups and any publisher membership conditions.

The location of the caspol utility is dependent upon the system architecture of the system running .Net.

For 32 bit systems, caspol.exe is located at %SYSTEMROOT%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319.
 
For 64 bit systems, caspol.exe is located at %SYSTEMROOT%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319.

Example:

cd %SYSTEMROOT%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319

To check code groups for the machine, run the following command:

caspol.exe -m -lg

Sample Results:
Microsoft (R) .NET Framework CasPol 4.0.30319.1

Success

Section 1.6 above indicates the presence of a publisher's key that meets the Publisher's Membership Condition and is also given full trust.

If the Publisher Membership Condition is used on a nondefault Code Group and the use of that publisher's certificate is not documented and approved by the ISSO, this is a finding.

RULE             : CAS and policy configuration files must be backed up.
QUESTION_TEXT    : The infrastructure to enable Code Access Security (CAS) exists only in .NET Framework 2.x-4.x.

The requirement is Not Applicable (NA) for .NET Framework greater than 4.x.

(Note: The infrastructure is deprecated and is not receiving servicing or security fixes.)

Ask the System Administrator if all CAS policy and policy configuration files are included in the system backup. If they are not, this is a finding.

Ask the System Administrator if the policy and configuration files are backed up prior to migration, deployment, and reconfiguration. If they are not, this is a finding.

Ask the System Administrator for documentation that shows CAS Policy configuration files are backed up as part of a disaster recovery plan. If they have no documentation proving the files are backed up, this is a finding.

QUESTION_ID      : ocil:navy.navwar.niwcatlantic.scc.dotnet:question:2701
RULE             : Software utilizing .Net 4.0 must be identified and relevant access controls configured.
QUESTION_TEXT    : This requirement does not apply to the "caspol.exe" assembly or other assemblies provided with the Windows OS or the Windows Secure Host Baseline (SHB).

Ask the system administrator to provide documentation that identifies:

- Each .Net 4.0 application run on the system.
- The .Net runtime host that invokes the application. 
- The security measures employed to control application access to system resources or user access to application.

For additional insight run: tasklist /fi "modules eq mscoree.dll"

If all .Net applications, runtime hosts and security protections have been documented or if there are no .Net 4.0 applications existing on the system, this is not a finding.

If there is no documentation that identifies the existence of .NET 4.0 applications or the lack thereof, this is a finding.

If the runtime hosts have not been identified, this is a finding.

If the security protections have not been identified, this is a finding.
