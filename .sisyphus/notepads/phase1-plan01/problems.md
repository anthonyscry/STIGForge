# Phase 1 Plan 01 - Unresolved Problems

## [2026-02-03] Current Blockers

### Delegation System Non-Functional
**Status:** BLOCKED - Cannot use delegate_task()
**Error:** "Delegation plugin requires a default model"
**Impact:** Must complete tasks directly instead of delegating to specialized agents
**Workaround:** Direct implementation with manual verification

### No Active Blockers for Implementation
All technical requirements are clear and testable. Proceeding with direct implementation.
