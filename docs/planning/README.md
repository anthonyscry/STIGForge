# Planning Artifacts

This folder contains non-runtime planning and scaffolding material that was previously at the repository root.

- `RepoTemplatePrompt.md` - original repo/template prompt draft
- `SpecPrompt.md` - product specification prompt
- `RoadmapExecution.md` - sprint roadmap narrative
- `RoadmapExecutionImport.csv` - roadmap import sheet
- `ScaffoldingNotes.md` - scaffold notes and generated setup guidance
- `scaffolding-script.ps1` - original scaffolding script snapshot

Keeping these files here reduces root-level clutter and makes operational files easier to find.
